# High-Level Documentation

## Overview

This code serves as the main entry point for a React application. It is responsible for rendering the root component of the application into the HTML DOM.

## Key Components

- **React & ReactDOM Imports**: Imports the necessary React libraries (React and ReactDOM) for building and rendering the application.

- **App Component**: Imports the main `App` component, which represents the root component of the application.

- **Root Rendering**:
  - Locates the DOM element with the id `root`.
  - Creates a React root to manage the rendering.
  - Renders the `App` component inside a `React.StrictMode` wrapper. This wrapper activates additional checks and warnings for its descendants in development mode.

## Additional Notes

- **Performance Measurement**: There is an optional (commented-out) suggestion to include performance measuring logic via a `reportWebVitals` function.

- **Usage Context**: This is a standard starting template for React applications created using Create React App or a similar toolchain.
