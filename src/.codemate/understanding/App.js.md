# High-Level Documentation

## Overview

This code defines the main application structure for a React-based website, which appears to be an educational institution or service platform. The application uses `react-router-dom` for client-side routing, organizes content into multiple modular components, and utilizes Bootstrap for styling.

---

## Core Components

- **Header:** Displayed at the top of every page; likely includes navigation.
- **Footer:** Displayed at the bottom of every page.
- **Homepage, About, Facilities, Administration, Blog, Classrooms, Courses, Appointment, Contact, Profile:** Individual pages/components for different sections of the site.
- **Authentication:** Includes `Login` and `Signup` components for user authentication.
- **Notfound:** Handles undefined routes (404 error page).

---

## Routing

- Uses `BrowserRouter` (aliased as `Router`) to handle navigation without full page reloads.
- The `Routes` component defines multiple `Route` elements for distinct URL paths.
- The root path `/` and `/home` both map to the `Homepage`.
- Other descriptive paths (`/about`, `/facilities`, etc.) are mapped to respective section components.
- A wildcard route (`*`) is set up for all undefined URLs, leading to the `Notfound` page.

---

## Styling

- Includes Bootstrapâ€™s core CSS and JS for consistent UI and layout.
- Also applies custom styles (`./css/bootstrap.css`, `./css/index.css`).

---

## Structure

- The `App` component acts as the main wrapper.
- The rendered layout always includes the `Header`, then main `content` (varying by current route), and the `Footer`.

---

## Usage

- This is the entry point of the application, exported as the default App component.
- Designed to be scalable: additional sections can be added as new components/routes.

| Feature/Component  | Purpose                           |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Header, Footer     | Persistent navigation & info      |

## Notes

- The application separates concerns cleanly via component architecture.
- Ensures a user-friendly, single-page application experience using React Router.
- Employs both standard and custom styles for visual design.
