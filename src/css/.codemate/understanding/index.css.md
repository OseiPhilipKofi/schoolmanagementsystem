# High-Level Documentation: Stylesheet Overview

This CSS code provides core styling for a web application featuring a modern, responsive layout with emphasis on gradient backgrounds and animated tab navigation. The code is modular and makes extensive use of CSS variables (custom properties), transitions, and animations for a rich interactive user experience.

## 1. Global Styles

- **Base Imports and Resets:**  
  - Imports variables from `root.css` (e.g., colors, gradients).
  - Removes default body margins, ensures antialiased font rendering, locks horizontal overflow.

- **Fonts:**
  - Sets a monospaced font for `code` elements.

## 2. Header and Navigation

- **Header (`.header-wrap`):**
  - Sticky header fixed to the viewport top, always visible, very high z-index.
  - Applies gradient backgrounds and color schemes.
  - Contains:
    - Navigation buttons (`.header-btn`), using smooth border and color transitions.
    - Logo and tab text styled for clear visibility.
    - Responsive tab containers (`.medium-page-tabs`, `.user-tabs`) with custom scrollbars hidden.

- **Tab Interactions:**
  - Tabs and links animate colors and gradients on hover and when active.
  - Uses advanced background clipping for gradient text effects.
  - Active tab highlights and animated backgrounds for visual feedback.

- **User Profile (in header):**
  - Circular avatar display with image clipping and object-fit.

## 3. Tabs & Navigation

- **Mini Tabs:**  
  - Horizontal flex layout for small option buttons or profile photos.

- **Medium/Page/User Tabs:**
  - Responsive row or column navigation, suitable for larger or user-specific menu items.
  - Consistent padding, spacing, icons.

- **Tab Animation:**
  - Custom animation for background gradients on just hovered or selected tabs.

## 4. Footer

- **Footer wrapper reserved** (`.footer-wrap`), minimal styles.

## 5. Home Page

- **Home-Page Wrapper** (`.home-wrap`):
  - Ensures minimum height, suggesting a design that keeps the main content centered or tall enough to displace the footer.

## 6. Mobile Navigation (`.phone-tabs`)

- **Structure:**
  - Fixed bar at the screen’s bottom, covers view width.
  - Horizontal scroll for overflow.
  - Contains navigation icons and text in column flex alignment.

- **Interactivity:**
  - Active states with animated backgrounds; icon and text color change to highlight the current page.
  - Hides scrollbars for a clean appearance.
  - Responsive adjustments for smaller screens, ensuring buttons remain usable and visually distinct.

## 7. Miscellaneous

- **Classes like `.translate-x`**:  
  - Utility to hide/move elements with a translateX transform for animations or off-canvas menus.

- **Media Queries:**
  - Refines `.phone-tabs` child layout for mobile (≤600px), making sure navigation remains accessible.

## **Design System Features**

- **Extensive use of CSS Variables:**  
   - Enables easy theming and visual customization across the UI for gradients, shadows, and text colors.
