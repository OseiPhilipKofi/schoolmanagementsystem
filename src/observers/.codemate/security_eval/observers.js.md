# Security Vulnerability Report

## Code Analyzed

The following React hook–like component was analyzed:

```javascript
import { useState } from "react";

const Resizeobserver = (params) => {
    const [isLarger, setIsLarger ] = useState(false);
    const [isSmaller, setIsSmaller ] = useState(false);

    new ResizeObserver(element =>{
        if(window.innerWidth >= 1200 ){
            setIsLarger(true);
        }else{
            setIsLarger(false);
        }
        if(window.innerWidth  < 600 ){
            setIsSmaller(true);
        }else{
            setIsSmaller(false);
        }
    }).observe(params);
    return{ isLarger, isSmaller }
}

export default Resizeobserver;
```

## Security Vulnerabilities

### 1. **Potential Denial of Service (Resource Exhaustion) through Observer Creation**

#### **Issue**
The code creates a new `ResizeObserver` every time the component function is called. In functional React components, this can happen on every re-render. Since there is no cleanup mechanism and no effect hooks being used, this could lead to an unbounded number of observers being created, leading to resource exhaustion.

#### **Impact**
- **Denial of Service**: Excessive observer creation can exhaust browser resources or crash the application, potentially leading to a DoS condition in the user's browser session.
- **Memory Leaks**: Orphaned observers are never disconnected, resulting in memory that is never released.

#### **Relevant Line**
```javascript
new ResizeObserver(element =>{ /*...*/ }).observe(params);
```

---

### 2. **Direct Use of DOM Node from Props**

#### **Issue**
The code assumes `params` is a valid DOM node and passes it directly to `.observe()`. If an attacker manages to supply a malicious or unexpected reference to this component (e.g., via a manipulated prop), it could result in runtime errors, leading to undefined behavior or potential exploitation depending on the consumer code context.

#### **Impact**
- **Security Boundary Violations**: Exploitation may occur if, in a broader context, the DOM node is not controlled or sanitized.
- **Potential Information Disclosure**: Malicious code might observe sensitive DOM structure changes or trigger callbacks at unexpected times.

#### **Relevant Line**
```javascript
}).observe(params);
```

---

### 3. **No Validation or Sanitization of Props**

#### **Issue**
There is no type or value validation for `params`. This not only increases the risk for runtime errors, but in advanced component compositions (especially for SSR or isomorphic rendering), it could introduce vectors for security misconfiguration.

#### **Impact**
- **Cross-Component Security Risks**: Where this component is nested in a broader ecosystem, lack of validation could introduce vulnerabilities when integrating with untrusted subtrees/elements.
- **Security Degradation**: Unexpected types or objects could be passed and unexpectedly observed.

---

### 4. **Improper Use of React Patterns (May Lead to Unsafe Behavior)**

#### **Issue**
While not a classic vulnerability, the use of side effects (creating observers) directly in the render body (outside of `useEffect`) is not safe. React’s rules of hooks expect side effects to be declared in `useEffect` or similar lifecycle methods, to prevent unpredictable behavior.

#### **Impact**
- **Promotes Anti-Patterns**: Developing using this code as a reference may lead to unsafe coding practices elsewhere, making the ecosystem more vulnerable to related issues.

## Summary Table

| Vulnerability                                    | Risk Level | Direct Exploitability | Impact                       |
|--------------------------------------------------|:----------:|:---------------------:|------------------------------|
| Repeated `ResizeObserver` creation (DoS)         | High       | Indirect              | Crash browser, memory leak   |
| Unvalidated / untrusted DOM node input           | Medium     | Contextual            | Unintended behavior, info leak |
| Lack of prop validation/sanitization             | Low        | Indirect              | Increased exposure for broader attacks |
| Unsafe React coding pattern                      | Medium     | Indirect              | Promotes unsafe code, potential bugs   |

## Recommendations

- **Move observer creation into a `useEffect`** that properly cleans up (`disconnects`) the observer on unmount/component update.
- **Validate `params`** to ensure it's a legitimate DOM node before observing.
- **Add prop-types or TypeScript** for enhanced type safety.
- **Never create side effects in the render body** — always use `useEffect` or similar, to prevent repeated instantiation and resource leaks.

## Final Security Verdict

**This code has significant potential for resource exhaustion and creates anti-patterns that may lead to vulnerabilities in larger applications. It requires refactoring and input validation for secure use.**
