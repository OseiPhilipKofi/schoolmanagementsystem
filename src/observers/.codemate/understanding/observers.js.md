# High-Level Documentation: `Resizeobserver` React Hook

## Overview

The `Resizeobserver` function is a custom React hook designed to monitor and update state based on the browser window's width. It leverages the `ResizeObserver` API to detect changes in the size of a provided DOM element, and accordingly sets React state flags to indicate whether the window is currently "large" (at least 1200 pixels wide) or "small" (less than 600 pixels wide).

## Purpose

- To provide responsive state (`isLarger` and `isSmaller`) within a React component, depending on the current width of the browser window.
- To enable components to easily determine if the viewport size meets certain conditions for responsive design (e.g., mobile vs. desktop layouts).

## Functionality

- Accepts a DOM element as input (`params`).
- Observes the element's size changes using `ResizeObserver`.
- Maintains two boolean state values:
  - `isLarger`: `true` if the window width is **1200px or greater**.
  - `isSmaller`: `true` if the window width is **less than 600px**.
- Updates these states dynamically in response to resize events.
- Returns an object containing the two state values for use within other React components.

## Usage Pattern

```js
const { isLarger, isSmaller } = Resizeobserver(myElementRef.current);
```
- Use these booleans in your React components to conditionally render or style content based on screen size.

## Notes

- The hook does not use `useEffect`, so the observer is (re)created every render, which may lead to performance or memory issues.
- The states are based on `window.innerWidth` and not the actual observed element size, despite utilizing `ResizeObserver`.
