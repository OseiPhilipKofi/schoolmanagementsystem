# Notfound Component - High-Level Documentation

## Overview

The `Notfound` component is a React functional component designed to display a user-friendly "404 Page Not Found" error screen. It is typically used within a React application to handle cases where users navigate to a route that does not exist.

## Key Features

1. **Error Display**: Shows a visually appealing error page when a user lands on an invalid URL.
2. **Current Path Info**: Displays the actual incorrect path the user tried to access.
3. **Visual Feedback**: Includes a custom SVG image to visually indicate the error.
4. **Styling**: Well-structured with CSS classes for layout and appearance, ensuring the error page is centered and styled appropriately.

## Main Implementation Details

- **Imports**:
  - Custom CSS for error page styling.
  - A custom SVG image to illustrate the error.
  - `useLocation` from `react-router-dom` to access the current browser path.

- **Path Formatting**:
  - Extracts the pathname from the browser's current location and converts it to lowercase for display.

- **Component Structure**:
  - Uses container divs with flex properties to center content.
  - Image and text elements show the error image, the erroneous path, and concise error messages ("page load error" and "Page not found").

- **Export**:
  - Exports the `Notfound` component for use in application routing.

**Typical Usage**  
This component is added to the application's routing configuration and rendered when no other route matches the user's request (the "catch-all" route). This improves user experience by clearly communicating navigation errors instead of leaving the user with a blank or confusing page.

**Summary**  
`Notfound` provides a polished, informative, and styled 404 error page for React applications.
