# Security Vulnerability Report

## Component: Notfound

### Code Sample

```javascript
import './css/notfound.css';
import notfound from '../../utility/Errorpage/404-page.svg';
import { useLocation } from "react-router-dom";
const Notfound = () => {
    const location = useLocation();
    const pathname = location.pathname.toLowerCase();

    return (
        <>
            <div className='error-page-wrap mum d-flex flex-column justify-content-center align-items-center p-3 pt-5'>
                <div className="img-wrapper d-block">
                    <img src={ notfound } alt="" />
                </div>
                <div className="btn-container d-flex flex-column justify-content-center align-items-center">
                    <h3 className="urltext"> .... { pathname }</h3>
                    <p className="head-text text-first">
                        page load error
                    </p>
                    <h3 className="head-text text-second">
                        Page not found
                    </h3>
                </div>
            </div>
        </>
     );
}

export default Notfound;
```

## Security Vulnerability Analysis

### 1. **Unescaped/Unsanitized Output of `pathname` (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS)**

#### Description
The code renders the `pathname` directly from the `useLocation` object into the HTML as:
```jsx
<h3 className="urltext"> .... { pathname }</h3>
```

- If the routing system ever allows client-controlled URLs or malicious input (for example, `/somepath/%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E`), React normally escapes these, but if you later move to dangerouslySetInnerHTML or a similar construct, or if there's a library introduced that removes this escaping at any point, you have set up a potential XSS vector. 
- If React is always used and outputs are never passed through anything unsafe, the risk is low, but showing attacker-controlled pathnames anywhere in your UI deserves caution and audit.

#### Recommendations
- Always ensure that all user-influencable data rendered is properly escaped. Avoid using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` or similar unless truly necessary.
- If functionality changes or new libraries/components are added, audit this usage carefully.
- You may consider filtering or encoding the path before rendering, or limiting its output.

---

### 2. **Information Disclosure via Pathname**

#### Description
Displaying the full path that the user tried to access (even in a 404) might leak sensitive information, especially if URL paths can contain tokens, IDs, or sensitive data by mistake (for example in query strings or fragment identifiers).

#### Recommendations
- Assess whether showing the full path is necessary for the user, or if a simplified message can be used.
- Remove or sanitize any sensitive or user-manipulable data before displaying it.
- If you decide to display user paths, consider omitting or redacting query strings and fragments.

---

### 3. **No Validation of Static Asset Loading**

#### Description
While not an immediate vulnerability in the provided code, note that if the `notfound` image (imported SVG) is replaced or manipulated with untrusted input due to misconfiguration in the asset pipeline or deployment, it could possibly lead to injection issues or unexpected behaviour.

#### Recommendations
- Ensure that static assets such as SVGs cannot be replaced with user-uploaded files or assets from untrusted sources.
- Validate and sanitize all SVG assets for possible script/content injection (in case SVGs are manipulated or user-generated in the future).

## Summary Table

| Vulnerability         | Severity | Description                              | Mitigation                                   |
|-----------------------|----------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| XSS via `pathname`    | Medium   | Client-controlled path is rendered.      | Always escape and audit, no direct or indirect use of innerHTML. |
| Information disclosure| Low      | Full path is shown, may leak info.       | Sanitize/omit sensitive query/fragment parts |
| Asset injection       | Low      | SVG could be a vector if misconfigured   | Keep assets trusted & sanitized              |

# Conclusion

The primary risk in this code is the rendering of `location.pathname` directly in the UI, which—while safe under normal React circumstances—should continue to be carefully monitored if more complex rendering or user-controlled data is involved. Never relax React's default escaping, and sanitize everything if in doubt. Consider whether showing the full path is necessary and avoid leaking sensitive route data.

**No active high-risk vulnerabilities were found, but maintain vigilance, especially as the application evolves.**
