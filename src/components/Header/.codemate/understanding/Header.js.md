## High-Level Documentation for `Header` Component

### Overview

The `Header` component is a responsive navigation bar, designed for a school-related web application using React and `react-router-dom`. It adapts its layout and visible controls based on the viewport size, supports dark/light theme toggling, displays user and navigation menus, and highlights the current active page.

### Key Features

1. **Responsive UI**
   - Uses a custom `Resizeobserver` hook to detect screen size and adjusts the navigation bar layout for large, medium, and small screens.
   - Three layouts:
     - **Desktop:** Full navigation menu with labeled tabs.
     - **Tablet:** Dropdown/slide-out navigation with icons.
     - **Mobile:** Icon-only navigation bar at the bottom/top.

2. **Navigation Controls**
   - Navigation links include: Home, About, Facilities, Administration, Blog, Classrooms.
   - Highlights the current active page.
   - Clicking a navigation link updates the active state, persists it in local storage, updates URL, and scrolls the window to the top.

3. **User Menu**
   - User profile image shown.
   - Clicking or hovering toggles a user menu with:
     - Profile, Login, Logout, Contact, Appointment links.
     - Theme toggle (dark/light).

4. **Theme Management**
   - Supports toggling between light and dark themes.
   - Remembers user’s theme preference using `localStorage`.
   - Updates the document’s theme attribute when changing.
   - Theme toggle is visually represented with an icon.

5. **UI Effects**
   - Header background and shadow change on scroll for visual feedback.

6. **Persistence**
   - The current page and theme are stored in `localStorage` to maintain state across reloads or navigation.

7. **Icons**
   - Uses FontAwesome for consistent iconography across tabs and user menu items.

### High-Level Logic Flow

1. On component mount:
   - Detect page and theme from `localStorage`.
   - Apply/current page highlighting and theme.
   - Set up event listeners for scroll to change header style.

2. When user interacts:
   - Clicking navigation or user menu items updates active tab, theme, and UI visibility.
   - On smaller or medium screens, menus are collapsed into dropdowns or icons for better usability.

3. On view resize:
   - Via `Resizeobserver`, adjust layout and which navigation controls are visible.
