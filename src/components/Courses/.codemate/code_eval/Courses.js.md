`Courses` component

---

## Summary

The `Courses` component is a basic functional React component. It adheres to fundamental React usage and is unlikely to introduce major bugs. However, there are opportunities for improvement regarding **industry standards**, **readability**, and **minor unoptimized implementations**.

---

## Issues & Suggestions

### 1. **Unnecessary Fragment Usage**
**Observation:**  
You are using React fragment (`<>...</>`) at the top level, wrapping only a single div. This is unnecessary and adds no value.

**Reference:**  
Fragments are primarily useful for returning multiple sibling elements. If there's a single root element, the fragment is redundant.

**Suggested Correction:**  
```
// Remove the <> and </> wrapping the <div>
return (
    <div className="courses">
        <h1>Courses</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the Courses page. Here you can find information about the courses we offer.</p>
    </div>
);
```

---

### 2. **Component Naming Consistency**
**Observation:**  
Function components should be named in PascalCase, which is already correct (`Courses`). However, it's a good practice to match the file name to the component name for maintainability and discoverability.

**Suggested Correction:**  
- Ensure the file name matches the component: `Courses.jsx` or `Courses.tsx`.

---

### 3. **Accessibility Improvement**
**Observation:**  
The component is simple, but accessibility best practices should be considered, such as ensuring that important heading levels (`<h1>`) are unique on the page.

**Suggested Correction:**  
- Ensure there are not multiple `<h1>` elements on the same page elsewhere, or adjust to `<h2>` as appropriate.

---

### 4. **Prop Usage & Scalability**
**Observation:**  
Currently, the component is not using any props. If you intend for this component to be static, this is fine. However, for scalability, you can accept props (e.g., course information) in the future.

**Suggested Correction:**
```
// Accept props for future scalability
const Courses = ({ courseList }) => { ... }
```
*(This is optional, for anticipated requirements.)*

---

### 5. **Export Statement Consistency**
**Observation:**  
The export statement is correct. For larger applications, named exports may be preferred for tree-shaking and refactoring ease.

| Issue                       | Type           | Line(s)     | Correction (pseudo code)                                    |
|-----------------------------|----------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Unnecessary Fragment        | Optimization   | return(...) | Remove `<></>` around `<div>`                               |
| File/Component Name Match   | Convention     | File name   | Ensure filename matches component: `Courses.jsx`            |
| Accessibility (Heading)     | Best Practice  | `<h1>`      | Ensure unique/appropriate heading level on the page         |
| Future Prop Usage           | Scalability    | Component   | Optionally add props: `const Courses = ({ courseList })...` |

---

## Actionable Corrections (Pseudo code)

```
// 1. Return only the div, without a fragment
return (
    <div className="courses">
        <h1>Courses</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the Courses page. Here you can find information about the courses we offer.</p>
    </div>
);

// 2. (Optional future-proofing)
// Accept props for dynamic content (future scalability)
const Courses = ({ courseList }) => {
    // use courseList as needed
}

// 3. (Optional accessibility review)
// Replace <h1> with <h2> if <h1> is already present elsewhere, to keep semantic consistency
<h2>Courses</h2>
```

---

## Conclusion

- Remove the unnecessary React fragment.
- Confirm file/component name convention is consistent.
- (If needed) Prepare to accept props for future scalability.
- (If applicable) Review heading levels for accessibility.

No critical bugs found. The code is safe for production with these minor adjustments.
