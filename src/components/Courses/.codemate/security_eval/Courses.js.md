# Security Vulnerability Report

## Code Under Review

```javascript
const Courses = () => {
    return (
        <>
            <div className="courses">
                <h1>Courses</h1>
                <p>Welcome to the Courses page. Here you can find information about the courses we offer.</p>
            </div>
        </>
     );
}

export default Courses;
```

## Security Vulnerabilities Identified

### 1. Lack of User Input or Data Handling

**Analysis:**  
The provided component is a static React component and does **not** process any user input or display dynamic content fetched from an external source (API, URL params, etc.).

- **No use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`**
- **No use of user-generated or external content in the UI**

**Vulnerabilities:**
- There is currently **no opportunity** for injection attacks, such as:
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - Remote Code Execution (RCE)
  - Information Disclosure

### 2. No Authentication or Authorization Logic

**Analysis:**  
This component does not implement, require, or bypass authentication or authorization logic, nor does it expose restricted resources.

### 3. Client-Side Only / No Network Requests

**Analysis:**  
There are no HTTP requests or API calls, so there is no risk of:
- Insecure transport (e.g., missing HTTPS)
- Leaking sensitive tokens
- Exposing sensitive URLs or credentials

### 4. No Use of Third-party Libraries or Packages

**Analysis:**  
The code contains only React and JSX, without any third-party code that could introduce vulnerabilities.

## Summary Table

| Vulnerability            | Present? | Description             |
|--------------------------|----------|-------------------------|
| Cross-Site Scripting     | ❌        | No user/external input rendered |
| Remote Code Execution    | ❌        | No code execution paths        |
| Sensitive Data Exposure  | ❌        | No secrets/data in code        |
| Insecure Deserialization | ❌        | No deserialization            |
| Insecure API Usage       | ❌        | No network calls              |
| Authentication Bypass    | ❌        | No auth logic                 |

---

## Recommendations

- **Maintain Static Nature**: Keep content static where possible to minimize attack surface.
- **Input Handling**: If this component is updated in the future to display dynamic/user-supplied content, ensure strict input validation and output encoding.
- **Secure Data Loading (Future Scope)**: When integrating APIs or external data, use secure practices (e.g., sanitize data, avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`).

---

## Conclusion

**No security vulnerabilities are present in the provided code as it stands. The component is purely static and poses no security risk.**

> ⚠️ **Note:** Security posture may change if new features are added or if the component begins to handle external/user data. Regular security reviews are recommended as the codebase evolves.
