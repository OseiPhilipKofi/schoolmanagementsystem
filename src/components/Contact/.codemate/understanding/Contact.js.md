**High-Level Documentation: Contact Component**

**Overview:**
The `Contact` component is a React functional component that renders a user interface for selecting different contact methods. The possible methods presented are Chat, Voice Call, and Video Call.

**UI Structure:**

- **Contact Options Header:**
  - Three selectable options, each with an icon and label:
    - Chat (with a chat/message icon)
    - Voice Call (with a phone icon)
    - Video Call (with a video camera icon)
  - The "Chat" option is marked as active by default, suggesting this would be the selected method initially.
  - Each option has data attributes for identifying the type of contact method.

- **Contact Body/Forms:**
  - Three corresponding form sections, each tied to a contact method:
    - Chat (title: "chat")
    - Voice Call (title: "Call")
    - Video Call (title: "send Note")
  - Each form section includes placeholders but does not currently contain input elements or functional logic.

**Functionality:**
- This component is purely presentational; it does not contain any logic for handling selection changes, form submission, or data management.
- Likely relies on external JavaScript/CSS for interaction such as highlighting the active category or displaying the appropriate form.

**Usage:**
- Designed to be imported and used within a larger React application where contact method selection is required.
- Further functionality (switching tabs, handling input, etc.) must be implemented elsewhere or enhanced within this component.

**Styling and Classes:**
- Uses a set of CSS classes for structure and styling (e.g., `contact-wrap`, `category`, `pointer`, `cactive`).
- Uses Font Awesome icon classes for visual representation of contact options.

**Limitations:**
- Static content; no event handlers or state management implemented.
- The mapping between contact option selection and displayed form is not implementedâ€”it must be handled for full interactivity.

This component sets up the structure for a contact panel with three modes but leaves user interaction and data handling to be implemented.
