**High-Level Documentation: CSS Layout for Main Content Section**

---

**Overview:**
This CSS code styles a main content area suitable for a modern, responsive web application. The layout uses flexbox and grid to organize sections such as a primary content area, image carousel, and a set of functionalities (possibly feature cards). The design adapts for both mobile and desktop screen sizes, supporting visual polish with rounded corners, shadows, and custom color variables from an external root stylesheet.

**Key Structural Elements:**

1. **main-content-wrap**
   - Serves as the container for all major content.
   - Uses a flex column layout, centered with consistent spacing (gap: 50px).
   - Full-width, responsive, and prevents horizontal overflow.

2. **first-content**
   - The main featured section or hero area inside `main-content-wrap`.
   - Rounded corners and optional shadow.
   - Layout adjusts:
     - **Mobile (<800px):** Stacks elements vertically, fills width and height.
     - **Desktop (â‰¥800px):** Uses a horizontal flex layout, separates text and image, maintains a minimum height.

3. **img-box and Images**
   - Styles image containers with controlled width and ensures images are covered, rounded, and clipped as intended.
   - In `image-courosel`, images are presented as circles (border-radius: 50%).

4. **image-courosel**
   - Row of images representing a carousel/gallery.
   - Displays images in a row with spacing, responsive sizing, and circular cropping.

5. **functionalities**
   - Displays a grid of feature/utility cards (three per row on desktops).
   - Cards are styled with rounded corners, background color, and padding.

6. **function, func-header-wrap, content-wrap**
   - Each functionality card uses flex column layout for header and content alignment.

**Responsive Design:**

- **@media (max-width: 800px):**
  - `.first-content` becomes single-column, fills container width, and occupies vertical space.

- **@media (min-width: 800px):**
  - `.first-content` arranges as two columns (image and text).
  - Enhanced padding, background blur, and shadow on text box.
  - Large, animated gradient text for the header via `background-clip` and keyframe animation.

---

**Styling Features:**

- Use of CSS variables for colors and backgrounds (e.g., `--white`, `--shadow`, `--cardBackground`, `--text-key`).
- Modern flex & grid layouts for alignment and spacing.
- Cross-browser border-radius and animation properties.
- Visual enhancements like background blur, gradient text, and box shadows.

**Intended Use-Case:**
A visually modern, responsive landing or dashboard section with hero image/text, feature cards, and a gallery/carousel component. Can be adapted for a variety of content-driven applications.
