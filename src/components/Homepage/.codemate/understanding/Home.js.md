# Homepage Component - High Level Documentation

## Overview
This code defines a simple React functional component called Homepage. It is responsible for rendering the homepage layout of an application or website.

## Key Features
- **Imports a Child Component:** Imports and renders another component named FirstContent, which likely displays the main content for the homepage.
- **Styling:** Imports a CSS file (`home.css`) to style the homepage.
- **HTML Structure:** Wraps the FirstContent component inside a div with a CSS class (`home-wrap`) for layout or styling purposes.
- **Functional Component:** Uses React's function component syntax and JSX to declare the structure to be rendered.

## Usage
This component acts as a container for homepage-level content and can be used as the main entry point for the home route in a React application.

## Extensibility
Additional homepage elements or components can be inserted alongside or around FirstContent within the same layout. The CSS file can be modified to adjust styling as needed.
