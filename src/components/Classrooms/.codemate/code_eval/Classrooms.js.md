# Code Review Report: `Classrooms` Component

## Overview

The reviewed code is a basic React functional component named `Classrooms`. It renders a section with a title and a description.

---

## Critical Review

### 1. Unnecessary Fragment Wrapping

**Observation:**  
The componentâ€™s returned JSX is unnecessarily wrapped with a React Fragment (`<>...</>`), even though there is only one root element inside (`<div className="classrooms">...</div>`). The fragment adds no value and may marginally impact readability/performance.

**Correction:**  
Remove the fragment if there is only a single root node.

```pseudo
// Replace:
return (
    <>
        <div className="classrooms">
            ...
        </div>
    </>
);

// With:
return (
    <div className="classrooms">
        ...
    </div>
);
```

### 2. Function Declaration Consistency

**Observation:**  
The function body is written with an explicit `return` statement. For simple presentational components, using an implicit return via arrow function can improve conciseness.

**Suggestion:**  
Use implicit return for simple functional components.

```pseudo
// Replace:
const Classrooms = () => {
    return (
        <div className="classrooms">
            ...
        </div>
    );
}

// With:
const Classrooms = () => (
    <div className="classrooms">
        ...
    </div>
);
```
*This is optional but is often preferred for succinct presentational components.*

---

### 3. File Naming and Component Conventions

**Observation:**  
Ensure that the component file is named `Classrooms.jsx` (or `.js` if not using JSX extension), matching the default export for clarity and maintainability.

---

### 4. Documentation and Comments

**Suggestion:**  
Add a brief comment describing the component above its declaration for easier maintainability.

```pseudo
// Add above the component:
/// Renders the Classrooms page section with title and description.
```

---

## Summary

- Remove unnecessary React Fragments.
- Optionally use an implicit return for cleaner presentational components.
- Add concise documentation comments.
- Ensure file naming matches the component for clarity.

These changes will enhance code clarity, maintainability, and adherence to common industry standards.
