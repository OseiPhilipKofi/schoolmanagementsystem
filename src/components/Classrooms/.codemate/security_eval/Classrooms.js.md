# Security Vulnerability Report

## Code Analyzed

```jsx
const Classrooms = () => {
    return (
        <>
            <div className="classrooms">
                <h1>Classrooms</h1>
                <p>Welcome to the Classrooms page. Here you can find information about our classrooms.</p>
            </div>
        </>
     );
}

export default Classrooms;
```

## Security Vulnerabilities Identified

After analyzing the provided code, here is a detailed security assessment:

### 1. User Input & DOM Injection

- **Observation:**  
  The component renders only static content. There is no handling or inclusion of dynamic data (such as user input, props, or external data sources) in the DOM.
- **Assessment:**  
  There is **no risk of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** or DOM injection in this code as written, since only hardcoded strings are rendered.

### 2. Data Handling

- **Observation:**  
  There is no data fetching, API calls, or external input parsing in this component.
- **Assessment:**  
  **No vulnerabilities related to insufficient input validation, insecure data handling, or API misuse** are present.

### 3. Use of Third-Party Libraries

- **Observation:**  
  No third-party libraries or dependencies are imported or used here.
- **Assessment:**  
  **No library-based vulnerability surface** in the presented code.

### 4. Authentication & Authorization

- **Observation:**  
  The component is strictly presentational.
- **Assessment:**  
  There is **no session management or authorization logic** included, so no related vulnerabilities.

### 5. Sensitive Data Exposure

- **Observation:**  
  No sensitive data, secrets, or keys are included in the code.
- **Assessment:**  
  **No risk of accidental secret/data leakage**.

### 6. Client-Side Security Best Practices

- **Observation:**  
  No event handlers, no use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, and nothing that manipulates cookies or localStorage.
- **Assessment:**  
  **No significant client-side security risks are present**.

## Recommendations

- If dynamic content or user input is added in the future, always **sanitize and validate** data before rendering.
- **Monitor** and audit for security if/when third-party libraries or input handling are introduced.
- Follow React best practices for security, such as avoiding `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` unless absolutely necessary and sanitized.

## Conclusion

**No security vulnerabilities found in the provided code.**  
The `Classrooms` component only renders static, hardcoded content and has no external dependencies, user input, or sensitive data. It is currently secure in isolation.
