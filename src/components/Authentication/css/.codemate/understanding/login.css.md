# High-Level Documentation: Authentication Form CSS

## Overview
This CSS code styles a multi-purpose authentication form interface, supporting both login and registration (sign-in) functionalities. It establishes the layout, appearance, interaction states, and responsive elements for form containers, input fields, feedback messages, and action buttons, as well as Google authentication UI.

---

## Layout and Structure
- **Main Container (`.formWrapper`)**: 
  - Uses flexbox for horizontal centering of form sections.
  - Stretches to full width.

- **Form Sections (`.loginWrapper`, `.signinWrapper`)**: 
  - Block display with a maximum width to ensure compact form presentation.
  - Toggles visibility for register/sign-in vs. login forms.

- **Forms**: 
  - Centralized, responsive, padded, and with minimum width constraints.

---

## Input Components
- **Field Groups (`.eachInput`)**:
  - Block-level, full-width elements to stack fields vertically.
  - Labels and inputs closely aligned for usability.
  - Password and select fields styled for prominence, with animated focus states.

- **Special States**:
  - Focused input fields highlight the bottom border.
  - Placeholders and labels animate slightly on interaction.
  - Show/hide password functionality positioned and styled.

- **Password Strength/Feedback**:
  - Areas provided to show password strength tips and visual cues.

---

## Buttons and Actions
- **Action Buttons (`.btns`)**:
  - Flex, horizontally centered, with gap spacing between actions.
  - Primary, secondary, and tertiary actions styled with distinct background colors, using CSS variables.
  - Buttons are rounded and transition smoothly on interaction.
 
- **Submit and Auth Buttons**:
  - Prominent, full-length where appropriate.
  - Google authentication button styled with image/logo support.

---

## Feedback and Messages
- **Message Display (`.messages`)**: 
  - Area for displaying success and error messages.
  - Colored via CSS variables for clarity (e.g., red for errors, green for success).
  - Centrally aligned and uses capitalization for emphasis.

---

## Miscellaneous Features
- **"Forgot Password" Section**:
  - Organized spacing and alignment for links.
- **Google Authentication**:
  - Dedicated styles for Google sign-in, with branding adherence.
  - Support for images and concise text display.

---

## Responsiveness and Usability
- Elements are responsive via max-widths, minimum widths, and flexible layouts.
- Text selection, capitalization, and pointer behaviors improve user experience.
- All interactive and feedback elements use CSS transitions for smoothness.

---

## Theming and Colors
- Makes extensive use of CSS variables for easy theming (`--danger`, `--success`, `--btnmain`, etc.).
- Backgrounds, text, and border colors can be adjusted centrally.

## Purpose
This CSS framework is intended for use with web-based authentication forms, ensuring visually consistent, user-friendly login and registration interfaces, with support for error/success messaging and third-party authentication.
