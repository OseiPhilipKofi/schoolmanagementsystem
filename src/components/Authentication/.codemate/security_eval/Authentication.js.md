# Security Vulnerability Report

## Codebase: `Authentication` Component

---

### 1. **Insecure Form Submission**

- **Description:**   
  Both the login and sign-up forms use HTML attributes:  
  ```html
  <form action="#" method="post" id="loginForm">
  ```
  and
  ```html
  <form action="#" method="post" id="signinForm">
  ```
  In React, form data should **not** be submitted via the DOM directly due to XSS and CSRF risks. Form submissions should be handled in React event handlers, with necessary sanitization and validation.

- **Risks:**  
  - Incorrect or unintended POST targets.
  - Susceptibility to CSRF if not protected.
  - Bypassing React’s state and validation.

- **Recommendation:**  
  - Prevent the default form submission (`event.preventDefault()`).
  - Handle submission in a React function.
  - Always sanitize and validate user input.

---

### 2. **No CSRF Protection**

- **Description:**  
  There is no evidence of CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) tokens being used in these forms.

- **Risks:**  
  - Attackers could forge form submissions, possibly tricking users into performing unwanted actions if server-side is not protected.

- **Recommendation:**  
  - Always use CSRF tokens for forms that perform sensitive actions.
  - Integrate with server-side CSRF validation.

---

### 3. **Potential for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

- **Description:**  
  - Error/success messages are directly rendered:
    ```jsx
    <div class="errMessage" id="errMessage1"></div>
    ```
    No evidence is shown for how error/success messages are set, but if these are set with unescaped user input, XSS vulnerabilities may occur.

- **Risks:**  
  - Potentially malicious input can be rendered blindly.
  - User sessions/data can be hijacked or manipulated.

- **Recommendation:**  
  - Always sanitize any user input before rendering it in the DOM.
  - Use data binding in React, rather than manipulating the DOM directly.

---

### 4. **Password Fields and Password Security**

- **Description:**  
  - Easily accessible password fields with "show password" options.
  - No client-side password policy enforcement (e.g., required length, character types).

- **Risks:**  
  - Weak passwords can be entered without detection.
  - Passwords visible on-screen can be seen by shoulder-surfers.

- **Recommendation:**  
  - Enforce strong password policies client-side.
  - If you allow "show password", provide clear warnings and ensure it's opt-in.

---

### 5. **Insecure or Misleading Google OAuth Button**

- **Description:**  
  The Google sign-up button:
  ```jsx
  <div onclick="" class="google-btn ..."> ... </div>
  ```
  No actual handler is provided, which could mislead users or get filled incorrectly in the future.

- **Risks:**  
  - If an insecure or misconfigured handler gets added, could lead to phishing or privilege escalation vulnerabilities.

- **Recommendation:**  
  - Implement proper OAuth flows with secure redirection to Google’s servers.
  - Never store Google credentials on client-side.

---

### 6. **Potential HTML Injection via Attributes**

- **Description:**  
  `<input>` elements use `name`, `id`, and other values directly. If these values are ever populated dynamically with user input (not shown here, but possible in future refactors), this could lead to attribute injection.

- **Risks:**  
  - Potential HTML or JS injections.

- **Recommendation:**  
  - Never use unchecked user input in attribute values.

---

### 7. **Incorrect Use of HTML Attributes in React**

- **Description:**  
  - Use of `class` instead of `className`.
  - Use of `for` instead of `htmlFor` in `<label>`.

- **Risks:**  
  - These mistakes do not immediately create security vulnerabilities, but can break React’s DOM sanitization and open indirect attack vectors (such as incorrect attribute mapping causing layout/logic issues).

- **Recommendation:**  
  - Always use React conventions (`className`, `htmlFor`) to maintain consistent, secure DOM handling.

---

### 8. **No Input Validation**

- **Description:**  
  There is no evidence of validation on any input fields (e.g., checking for SQL injection, script tags, etc.).

- **Risks:**  
  - Malicious input can propagate to backend APIs or result in client-side errors.

- **Recommendation:**  
  - Sanitize and validate all user input client-side.
  - Repeat validation and sanitization server-side.

---

### 9. **Potential for Open Redirects and Routing Vulnerabilities**

- **Description:**  
  The usage of:
  ```jsx
  <Link href="/reset-password" class="word-no-wrap">Forgotten password ? </Link>
  ```
  In `react-router-dom`, navigation should use `to` instead of `href`.

- **Risks:**  
  - If `href` is ever populated dynamically or manipulated, could be used for open redirects or phishing links.

- **Recommendation:**  
  - Use `<Link to="...">` in React Router, and never allow user-controlled values for routing without severe validation.

# **Conclusion**

This component, as written, exposes multiple critical and high-risk security vulnerabilities due to improper form handling, lack of CSRF protections, potential for XSS, weak or missing input validation/sanitization, and React syntax mistakes. Immediate remediation is necessary to ensure the security of user data and application integrity.
