# Login Component: High-Level Documentation

## Overview

The `Login` component is a React functional component designed to render a login form interface with several options for user authentication. It is styled via an external CSS file and integrates routing capabilities using `react-router-dom`. The form offers traditional username/password login, Google authentication, and quick links for user registration and password reset.
