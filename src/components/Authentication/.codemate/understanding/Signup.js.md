# High-Level Documentation: `Signup` Component

## Overview

   - **Login Redirect:** Button to navigate users to the login page using React Router's `<Link>` component.

3. **Third-Party Authentication:**
   - **Google Sign Up:** Option to register using a Google account, with a click handler (`signUpAuthentication`) placeholder.

## Usage

- **Component Import:** Designed to be used within a React Router-enabled app.
- **Form Submission:** The core registration logic and validation are not implemented in this code (placeholders exist).
- **Third-Party Auth:** The function to handle Google authentication is emptyâ€”a hook for integration.

## Structure

```jsx
<Signup />
```

- Main wrapper div for form layout and styling.
- Form containing input fields for user details and authentication.
- Conditional rendering for error/success messages.
- Buttons for form submission, login navigation, and Google sign-up.

---

## Customization/Integration Notes

- Validation and authentication logic need to be implemented for functional registration.
- The "Sign up with Google" button should be linked to an actual authentication flow.
- Placeholder elements for feedback (`errMessage2`, `sucMessage2`, `passStrength2`) are present but require backend or client logic.
- The password visibility toggle is UI-only in current form.

## External Dependencies

- `react-router-dom` for routing (`Link`)
- Local CSS file for custom styles
- Image asset for the Google sign-in option

## Summary

This component provides a skeleton UI for a modern sign-up page including traditional registration and Google-based authentication, ready for further back-end and authentication integration.
