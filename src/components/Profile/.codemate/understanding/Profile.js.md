## **Component Overview**

- **Type:** Functional React component
- **Purpose:** Provides a user interface for displaying and editing a user's profile in a web application.

---

## **Key Features**

1. **Profile Display and Edit Form**
    - Shows a profile section with user details such as profile picture, username, email, phone number, country, and city.
    - Includes a form for editing select profile information.

2. **Profile Picture Section**
    - Displays a user profile image.
    - Handles image errors by displaying a default image (`errorImg`).
    - Provides a hidden file input for uploading/changing the profile picture. Users trigger image upload by clicking a "Change Profile" button styled as a label.

3. **Read-only and Editable Fields**
    - **Username** and **Email** fields are presented as disabled, making them read-only.
    - **Phone Number**, **Country**, and **City** fields are editable for the user.

4. **Messages Area**
    - Displays error and success messages dynamically (element containers present for message injection).

5. **Styling and Layout**
    - Utilizes a combination of custom CSS classes and Bootstrap utility classes for layout (flex, alignment, padding).
    - Custom button styling for the "Change Profile" action.

6. **Icons**
    - Uses FontAwesome for the "edit" icon on the image change button.

## **Props and State**

- This version does **not** accept any props or use React state/hooks. The fields and events would need to be extended for actual profile updating or data handling.

---

## **External Dependencies**

- **CSS:** Imports `profile.css` for component-specific styling.
- **Images:** Uses a default user image for profile display.
- **Icons:** Uses `@fortawesome/react-fontawesome` for UI icons.

---

## **Usage Context**

- Meant for use in user profile sections of web apps or dashboards.
- Intended for extension with dynamic data and backend integration for profile management.

---

## **Limitations and Extensibility**

- Fields are not wired up to state or backend dataâ€”no actual data loading or submission logic present.
- Error and success messages are only placeholders.
- Image upload/change logic is not handled in this code.

## **Summary**

The `Profile` component provides a visually organized, form-based user profile editor with the ability to trigger profile image changes and edit certain personal information fields. It is structured for easy styling and integration but requires additional logic for full interactivity and data persistence.
