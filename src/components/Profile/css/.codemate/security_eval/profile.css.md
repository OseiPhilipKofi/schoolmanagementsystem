# Security Vulnerability Report

## Analyzed Code
CSS code for a profile page, including some import statements.

---

## Vulnerability Analysis

### 1. **@import External CSS File**
```css
@import url('../../../css/root.css');
```
**Description:**  
The CSS uses an `@import` statement to include another CSS file from a relative path.

**Vulnerability:**  
- **CSS Injection / Untrusted CSS Import:** If the `'../../../css/root.css'` file is not securely controlled or is user-editable, an attacker could inject malicious CSS. This can lead to:
    - Information leakage (side-channel CSS attacks)
    - UI Redressing (phishing lookalikes)
    - CSS-based tracking or exfiltration of user data
    - CSS-based XSS (proof-of-concept vulnerabilities allow exfiltration via CSS and HTML, especially in browsers where CSS selectors can interact with authenticated resources)
- **Supply Chain Risk:** If the import pointed to an external URL, control of the resource could introduce style-based attacks.

**Recommendation:**
- Ensure the imported CSS file is strictly controlled and not user-editable.
- Never allow users to select or influence imported CSS paths.
- Avoid importing CSS from untrusted/external sources without integrity protection (e.g., Subresource Integrity for supported assets).

### 2. **No HTML-Embedded Data (Low XSS Risk)**
**Observation:**  
This code does not embed user data directly, so there is **no evidence of XSS via style attribute injection within this CSS snippet**.

---

### 3. **Use of !important**
```css
max-width: 450px !important;
```
**Description:**  
Use of `!important` is sometimes discouraged for maintainability, but it is not a direct security issue unless CSS order is being used to override a secure-by-default setting, such as hiding a security notice/indicator (not applicable here).

## Summary Table

| Vulnerability       | Present? | Details                                                                | Recommendation                                     |
|---------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Untrusted CSS Import| Yes      | Could allow malicious CSS injection if not controlled.                 | Restrict and secure imported CSS resources.        |
| CSS Injection       | N/A      | No user-influence on this code segment.                                | Keep imports trusted; sanitize user-supplied paths.|
| XSS via CSS         | No       | No dynamic/user-supplied data in CSS provided.                         | N/A                                                |
| Supply Chain Risk   | Low      | Possible if import target is compromised or external.                   | Use only first-party, secured sources.             |

## Final Recommendation

- **Ensure the CSS import path and content are fully trusted and inaccessible to user manipulation.**
- **Do not accept user input to construct CSS file paths or allow user edits of imported CSS.**
- **Review and monitor imported CSS for changes/additions that could introduce vulnerabilities.**
